# Sonoff-ebb-and-flow
Complete DIY project for orchids and hydroponics.
For many, the best watering system for orchids is the immersion of
the pot. But I am very lazy: since I had a couple of orchids, I have
studied this automatic irrigation system for the windowsill.

The pots are watered with cyclical dives controlled by a timer. A
watering cycle is adjustable in duration (flow) 1...60 minutes, and in
repetition (ebb) from every 2 minutes to one every 14 days, to
adapt to all needs. In the case of multiple cycles within 24 hours,
the timing between day and night can be differentiated.

This project can also be used in hydroponics, for all types of plant,
according to the method known as 'ebb and flow' (flow and reflux:
like the tides).
